# Bamazon

Created an amazon like store front using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, Inquirer and CLI Table. 

The app takes in orders from customers and adjusts the store's inventory accrodingly. 

When node bamazon.js is initialized it will bring up the store front where the command line will display the products that are avaialble for purchase and will then prompt the customer for the item id that they want to purchase and the quantity.
